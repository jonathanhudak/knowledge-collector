Got it! You want to list videos from the YouTube channel "DaytradeWarrior" and retrieve the ID, full URL, description, and thumbnail URL for each video.

Here's a Python code snippet using the Google API Client Library for Python to achieve this. You'll need to install the library first if you haven't already:

from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Replace with your own API key

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Build the YouTube API service

youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)

# Get the channel ID

request = youtube.channels().list(
part="contentDetails",
forUsername="DaytradeWarrior"
)
response = request.execute()
uploads_playlist_id = response['items'][0]['contentDetails']['relatedPlaylists']['uploads']

# Retrieve videos from the uploads playlist

videos = []
next_page_token = None
while True:
request = youtube.playlistItems().list(
part="snippet",
playlistId=uploads_playlist_id,
maxResults=50, # Adjust as needed
pageToken=next_page_token
)
response = request.execute()

    for item in response['items']:
        video_id = item['snippet']['resourceId']['videoId']
        video_url = f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}"
        description = item['snippet']['description']
        thumbnail_url = item['snippet']['thumbnails']['default']['url']
        videos.append({
            'id': video_id,
            'url': video_url,
            'description': description,
            'thumbnail_url': thumbnail_url
        })

    next_page_token = response.get('nextPageToken')
    if not next_page_token:
        break

# Print the video information

for video in videos:
print(video)
Use code with caution.
Explanation:

API Setup: We initialize the YouTube API service using your API key.
Channel ID Retrieval: We use the channels.list endpoint to get the ID of the "DaytradeWarrior" channel's uploads playlist.
Video Retrieval: We use the playlistItems.list endpoint to retrieve videos from the uploads playlist. We iterate through pages of results using the nextPageToken until all videos are fetched.
Data Extraction: For each video, we extract the ID, construct the full URL, get the description, and retrieve the default thumbnail URL.
Output: We print the collected video information.
Remember to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key.
